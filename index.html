    <h1>What is Web Typography?</h1>
    <p>
        Wikipedia defines Web typography as anything that “refers to the use of fonts on the Web.” The article explains
        that web browsers controlled the look of fonts and styles until 1995, when Netscape introduced the <font> tag in
            HTML 2. Now most browsers automatically download fonts and designers have greater freedom to design with
            type on the web.

        Every designer has his or her own method for integrating text in to websites. Some designers do it with their
        end users in mind and make their text easy to read. Other designers opt to use small text or unreadable fonts
        because of other design constraints. Personally I would rather not include text than have it unreadable.
        Learning the following web typography tips and integrating them into your sites you will be able to layout your
        copy like an expert. All of the tips are very easy to use and easier to implement. The hardest part is
        remembering to use them.

        If letters do not have enough space between you cannot read them easily. This makes your reader’s job much more
        difficult. I find that letter spacing should be one pixel and possibly two pixels for larger fonts. You can see
        two examples of bad letter spacing below:
