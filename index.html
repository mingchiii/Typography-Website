                    The museums and galleries in NYC are some of the City’s most powerful draws. Destinations like the
                    Metropolitan Museum of Art, the American Museum of Natural History and the Whitney Museum of
                    American Art house immense collections and put on spectacular exhibitions. Couple these with the
                    wide array of galleries around town, and a trip to NYC becomes a visually stunning experience.

                    Broadway is the bright beating heart of the NYC’s performing arts scene. No visit to the City is
                    complete without experiencing the rousing entertainment available in Midtown Manhattan’s Theatre
                    District, where dozens of historic venues stage bold new musicals, long-running hits and fascinating
                    dramas every night of the week.
